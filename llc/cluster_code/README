this directory contains a copy of the infrastructure needed to run the
llc code on a cluster with a torque queue on many different pairs of
data files.  the examples are fully operational, including fake data
and shell scripts for setting up the computation.

begin by noting that we have a data directory and a computation
directory.  

data_files: the data directory has data files labeled according to
x.y.lab1 x.y.lab2, etc.  these data files are identical to the single
run case, but there are many values of x and y. x and y must be
numbers, and there must be a lab1 and lab2 for every x and
y. moreover, there must be a key_file that explains what x and y mean
(e.g., glucose and hemoglobin) in the format as per the example.

matrix_of_correlations: the computation directory has all the scripts
for moving the data and code such that it can be run by the
matlab/torque submission scripts. this directory contains the following:

submit_corr.m: matlab script for submitting a set of lagged linear
correlation and mutual information compuations.

submit_boot_corr.m: matlab script for submitting a set of lagged linear
correation and mutual information computations --- bootstrapped (thus it
outputs a confidience interval).

low_level_src: a directory with all the necessary source for carrying out
the compuation

collect_data.sh: a script for collecting all the data once the computation
is complete

job_setup.sh: a script that sets up the data and directory structure for
computation

delete_jobs.sh: a script for deleting jobs on torque

clean.sh: a script that deletes all the job_setup.sh constuction and all the
computational results
